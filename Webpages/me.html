      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutme">
        I am a highly motivated games design postgraduate from South Essex
        College of Further and Higher Education, looking to put my foot in the
        door in the video game industry that enables me to improve my 3D
        modelling, animation, texturing and programming skills further and
        develop my career path, as well as gaining more confidence by acquiring
        connections within the industry. I have created various games as a solo
        developer as well as working on projects within a team. With strong
        analytical and communication skills and attention to detail, my career
        aim is to acquire a role in which I can actively participate and
        contribute to the makings of a great game within a games studio.

      <h2>My works</h2>
      <p>
        I've created various forms of art in the past few years. Be it drawings,
        models, environments, animations or video games. Here are a few
        examples:
      </p>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>My university work</li>
        <li>My personal projects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In my spare time, I like to keep fit and active by going to the gym
        often and I also like to socialise with my friends occasionally. If I
        have a particular project that I want to work on, I would also use my
        time wisely to search for ways in which I can improve on my skills. I
        find that visiting sites such as Skillshare and Youtube provides me with
        a lot of opportunities and I can learn specific skills needed within the
        games industry through video tutorials relating to games design as well
        as seeking to learn skills not necessarily related to games design but
        skills I can still use within the world of 3D. I always like to seek
        various ways to enhance my skill set and become a better games designer.
